# SPARC Specification: synapsed-storage

## 1. Specification Phase

### 1.1 Project Overview
**Component Name**: synapsed-storage  
**Purpose**: Provide a comprehensive, privacy-first storage layer for the Synapsed ecosystem with support for local-first architecture, distributed storage, and post-quantum encryption.

### 1.2 Core Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
1. **Local-First Storage**
   - Primary data storage on user's device
   - Offline-capable with eventual consistency
   - Efficient binary serialization (bincode/postcard)
   - Cross-platform file system abstraction

2. **Distributed Storage Integration**
   - IPFS integration for content-addressed storage
   - Optional cloud backup with encryption
   - Peer-to-peer data synchronization
   - Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs)

3. **Data Security**
   - Post-quantum encryption at rest (using synapsed-crypto)
   - Key management and rotation
   - Secure deletion capabilities
   - Privacy-preserving search

4. **Storage Types**
   - Key-Value store for configuration and metadata
   - Document store for structured data
   - Blob storage for media and files
   - Time-series store for metrics and logs

5. **Performance Requirements**
   - Sub-millisecond local reads
   - Efficient batch operations
   - Streaming support for large files
   - Memory-mapped file support

#### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Compatibility**
   - Rust stable toolchain
   - WebAssembly compilation support
   - Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, mobile)
   - Integration with existing Synapsed components

2. **Scalability**
   - Handle millions of small objects
   - Support files up to 100GB
   - Efficient indexing and querying
   - Low memory footprint

3. **Reliability**
   - ACID transactions for critical data
   - Write-ahead logging
   - Automatic recovery from corruption
   - Backup and restore capabilities

### 1.3 User Stories

1. **As a Synapsed Chat user**, I want my messages stored locally with automatic encryption so that my conversations remain private even if my device is compromised.

2. **As a Synapsed Vault user**, I want my credentials synchronized across devices without exposing them to any central server.

3. **As a Synapsed Bank user**, I want transaction history cached locally for offline access while maintaining data integrity.

4. **As a developer**, I want a simple API to store and retrieve data with automatic encryption and synchronization.

5. **As a system administrator**, I want to monitor storage usage and performance metrics through the Serventis observability framework.

### 1.4 Acceptance Criteria

1. **Storage Operations**
   - [ ] Create, Read, Update, Delete operations complete in < 10ms for small objects
   - [ ] Batch operations support at least 1000 items per transaction
   - [ ] Stream large files without loading entirely into memory
   - [ ] Support concurrent read/write operations

2. **Security**
   - [ ] All data encrypted with post-quantum algorithms before storage
   - [ ] Key derivation follows best practices (Argon2id)
   - [ ] Secure deletion overwrites data multiple times
   - [ ] No plaintext data ever written to disk

3. **Synchronization**
   - [ ] Detect and resolve conflicts automatically
   - [ ] Sync only changed data (delta sync)
   - [ ] Handle network interruptions gracefully
   - [ ] Support selective sync policies

4. **Integration**
   - [ ] Works with synapsed-crypto for encryption
   - [ ] Reports metrics through synapsed-serventis
   - [ ] Uses synapsed-net for P2P synchronization
   - [ ] Integrates with synapsed-identity for access control

### 1.5 Edge Cases

1. **Storage Full**: Graceful degradation when disk space is exhausted
2. **Corruption**: Detect and recover from file corruption
3. **Concurrent Access**: Handle multiple processes accessing same data
4. **Large Files**: Efficient handling of files larger than available RAM
5. **Network Partitions**: Continue operating during sync failures
6. **Key Loss**: Recovery mechanisms for lost encryption keys

### 1.6 API Design

```rust
// Core traits
pub trait Storage: Send + Sync {
    type Error: std::error::Error;
    
    async fn get(&self, key: &[u8]) -> Result<Option<Vec<u8>>, Self::Error>;
    async fn put(&self, key: &[u8], value: &[u8]) -> Result<(), Self::Error>;
    async fn delete(&self, key: &[u8]) -> Result<(), Self::Error>;
    async fn scan(&self, prefix: &[u8]) -> Result<StorageIterator, Self::Error>;
}

pub trait DocumentStore: Storage {
    async fn query(&self, filter: Query) -> Result<QueryResult, Self::Error>;
    async fn index(&self, field: &str) -> Result<(), Self::Error>;
}

pub trait BlobStore: Storage {
    async fn stream_write(&self, key: &[u8]) -> Result<StreamWriter, Self::Error>;
    async fn stream_read(&self, key: &[u8]) -> Result<StreamReader, Self::Error>;
}

pub trait SyncableStorage: Storage {
    async fn sync(&self, peer: PeerId) -> Result<SyncStats, Self::Error>;
    async fn resolve_conflict(&self, conflict: Conflict) -> Result<Resolution, Self::Error>;
}
```
