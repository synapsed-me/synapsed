# Side-Channel Vulnerability Audit Report
## synapsed-crypto Codebase

### Executive Summary

This report details the findings from a comprehensive side-channel vulnerability analysis of the synapsed-crypto post-quantum cryptography implementation. The audit focused on identifying timing attacks, memory access patterns, and other side-channel vulnerabilities that could leak sensitive information.

### Critical Findings

#### 1. Variable-Time Operations in Compression Functions (utils.rs)

**Severity: HIGH**

The compression and decompression functions contain early exit conditions that depend on secret data:

```rust
// utils.rs, lines 156-167
for (i, chunk) in coeffs.chunks(2).enumerate() {
    if i >= bytes.len() {
        break; // VULNERABILITY: Early exit based on buffer size
    }
    // ...
}
```

**Impact**: The timing of these functions varies based on input size, potentially leaking information about coefficient values.

**Recommendation**: Ensure all loops run for the full expected iterations regardless of actual data size.

#### 2. Non-Constant Time Polynomial Operations (poly.rs)

**Severity: MEDIUM**

The `caddq` function uses conditional operations based on coefficient values:

```rust
// poly.rs, lines 55-59
pub fn caddq(&mut self) {
    for coeff in &mut self.coeffs {
        *coeff += (*coeff >> 15) & 3329;
    }
}
```

While this appears to use bit manipulation for constant-time behavior, the operation `(*coeff >> 15)` creates a data-dependent branch in the CPU's execution.

**Impact**: May leak information about coefficient signs through timing variations.

**Recommendation**: Use the `subtle` crate's constant-time primitives for all conditional operations.

#### 3. Secret-Dependent Array Indexing (kyber512.rs)

**Severity: HIGH**

Multiple instances of array indexing with secret-dependent values:

```rust
// kyber512.rs, lines 216-220
for i in 0..256 {
    let coeff = v_minus_stu.coeffs[i];
    let bit = if coeff > 832 && coeff < 2497 { 1 } else { 0 };
    m_prime.as_mut()[i / 8] |= bit << (i % 8);
}
```

**Impact**: The comparison `coeff > 832 && coeff < 2497` creates a timing side-channel that could leak message bits during decapsulation.

**Recommendation**: Replace with constant-time bit extraction using masking operations.

#### 4. Variable-Time Rejection Sampling (dilithium2.rs)

**Severity: HIGH**

The signing algorithm uses rejection sampling with secret-dependent conditions:

```rust
// dilithium2.rs, lines 579-587
if !z.check_norm(GAMMA1 as i32 - BETA as i32) {
    continue;
}
// ...
if hint_count > OMEGA {
    continue;
}
```

**Impact**: The number of loop iterations depends on secret values, creating a significant timing side-channel.

**Recommendation**: Implement a constant-time rejection sampling mechanism or use masking to hide rejection decisions.

#### 5. Non-Constant Time Modular Reduction (utils.rs)

**Severity: MEDIUM**

Barrett reduction implementation may have variable timing:

```rust
// utils.rs, lines 345-349
pub fn barrett_reduce(a: i16) -> i16 {
    const V: i32 = 20159;
    let t = (V as i32 * a as i32 + (1 << 25)) >> 26;
    (a - t as i16 * 3329) as i16
}
```

**Impact**: While the operations appear constant-time, the final subtraction and cast could have platform-dependent timing variations.

**Recommendation**: Verify constant-time behavior on target platforms and consider using assembly implementations for critical paths.

#### 6. Cache Timing in Matrix Operations (ntt.rs)

**Severity: MEDIUM**

NTT operations access arrays with predictable but position-dependent patterns:

```rust
// ntt.rs, lines 39-43
for j in 0..len {
    let t = montgomery_reduce((zeta as i32).wrapping_mul(coeffs[start + j + len] as i32));
    coeffs[start + j + len] = coeffs[start + j].wrapping_sub(t);
    coeffs[start + j] = coeffs[start + j].wrapping_add(t);
}
```

**Impact**: Cache timing attacks could potentially recover information about the transformation.

**Recommendation**: Consider cache-oblivious algorithms or ensure data is in cache before operations.

### Additional Observations

#### Positive Security Practices Found:

1. **Use of `subtle` crate**: The codebase correctly uses the `subtle` crate for some constant-time operations (e.g., `ct_eq`, `ct_select`).

2. **Secure memory handling**: The `SecureArray` and `SecureBytes` types properly implement zeroing on drop.

3. **Constant-time equality**: The `ct_eq` function provides constant-time comparison for byte arrays.

#### Areas Needing Improvement:

1. **Incomplete constant-time coverage**: While some operations use constant-time primitives, many critical paths still contain variable-time code.

2. **Lack of side-channel testing**: No evidence of systematic testing for timing leaks.

3. **Platform-specific considerations**: No platform-specific optimizations or protections for known vulnerable architectures.

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Replace all conditional branches on secret data with constant-time alternatives
   - Implement constant-time rejection sampling for Dilithium
   - Add timing attack test suite

2. **Short-term Improvements**:
   - Audit all array accesses for secret-dependent indexing
   - Implement cache-timing protections for matrix operations
   - Add side-channel countermeasures documentation

3. **Long-term Goals**:
   - Consider formal verification of constant-time properties
   - Implement platform-specific optimizations with security review
   - Add continuous integration tests for timing leaks

### Conclusion

The synapsed-crypto implementation shows good awareness of side-channel concerns in some areas but contains several critical vulnerabilities that could leak sensitive information through timing attacks. These issues are particularly concerning in a post-quantum cryptography library where security margins are still being established.

Priority should be given to addressing the variable-time operations in the core cryptographic functions, particularly in the Kyber decapsulation and Dilithium signing operations where timing leaks could directly compromise security.
