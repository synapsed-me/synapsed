# Performance Test Report - Synapsed Crypto

## Summary

The performance testing phase has revealed several implementation issues that need to be addressed before comprehensive benchmarks can be run.

## Test Results

### Unit Tests
- **29 tests passed** out of 31 total
- **2 tests ignored** (pending implementation):
  - Dilithium NTT not fully implemented yet
  - Dilithium key serialization not fully implemented

### Integration Tests
- **Compilation failures** due to API changes in the trait definitions
- Missing random number generator parameters in function calls

### Performance Tests
- **Dilithium performance test failed** due to slice size mismatch (48 bytes vs expected 32 bytes)
- This indicates an issue in the signing implementation

### Benchmark Suite
- **Compilation failures** in both Dilithium and Kyber benchmarks
- API mismatch: functions expect RNG parameters that are not being provided

## Key Issues Found

1. **API Inconsistency**: The trait definitions require RNG parameters but implementations and tests are not providing them
2. **Memory Safety Issue**: Slice size mismatches in Dilithium implementation could lead to panics
3. **Incomplete Implementations**: 
   - Dilithium NTT not fully functional
   - Key serialization producing incorrect sizes
4. **Unused Imports**: Multiple warnings about unused imports indicate incomplete integration

## Performance Metrics (Available)

From the partial Dilithium performance test run:
- **Dilithium2 Key Generation**: ~152Âµs per operation (before failure)

## Recommendations

1. **Fix API Consistency**: Update all function calls to include required RNG parameters
2. **Address Memory Safety**: Fix slice size mismatches in Dilithium signing
3. **Complete Implementations**: Finish NTT and serialization implementations
4. **Update Tests**: Ensure all tests match the current API
5. **Clean Up Code**: Remove unused imports and variables

## Next Steps

Before performance benchmarking can be properly conducted:
1. Fix the compilation errors in tests and benchmarks
2. Resolve the slice size mismatch in Dilithium signing
3. Complete the missing implementations
4. Re-run the full test suite

## Conclusion

While the core library shows promise with 29 passing unit tests, the integration and performance testing reveal that the implementation is not yet ready for production use. The API needs to be stabilized and critical bugs need to be fixed before meaningful performance metrics can be collected.
